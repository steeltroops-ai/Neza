# Security and Compliance Framework Rules

## Elite Standards for Enterprise-Grade Security and Regulatory Compliance

### üéØ WHEN TO USE THIS FILE

- Implementing comprehensive security frameworks and controls
- Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2)
- Designing data protection and privacy systems
- Establishing incident response and security monitoring

### ‚ö° QUICK REFERENCE

- **Security by Design**: Multi-layered security architecture
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, privacy, and regulatory compliance
- **Access Control**: Authentication, authorization, and identity management
- **Incident Response**: Monitoring, detection, and recovery procedures

### üîÄ DECISION TREE

```
If implementing security ‚Üí Security Architecture (Section 1)
If protecting data ‚Üí Data Protection (Section 2)
If managing access ‚Üí Identity and Access Management (Section 3)
If ensuring compliance ‚Üí Regulatory Compliance (Section 4)
```

### üéØ MISSION STATEMENT

These security and compliance framework rules establish the gold standard for creating secure, compliant systems that protect user data and meet enterprise regulatory requirements. Every principle is designed to guide the development of security-first applications that can withstand sophisticated attacks while maintaining user trust and regulatory compliance.

**Core Principles:**

- **Security by Design**: Integrate security considerations into every aspect of system architecture
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Assume no implicit trust and verify every access request
- **Data Protection Excellence**: Implement comprehensive data protection and privacy measures
- **Compliance Integration**: Embed regulatory compliance requirements throughout development
- **Incident Response Readiness**: Maintain comprehensive incident response and recovery capabilities

### üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN

#### **Defense-in-Depth Security Strategy**

1. Implement multiple layers of security controls to protect against various attack vectors
2. Use principle of least privilege for all user accounts, services, and system access
3. Design security controls that fail securely and maintain system integrity during failures
4. Implement comprehensive input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks
5. Use secure coding practices that eliminate common vulnerabilities like OWASP Top 10
6. Design authentication systems with multi-factor authentication and strong password policies
7. Implement proper session management with secure token generation and validation
8. Use encryption for all sensitive data both at rest and in transit
9. Design network security with proper segmentation and access controls
10. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for security event detection

#### **Identity and Access Management**

11. Implement centralized identity and access management with single sign-on capabilities
12. Use role-based access control (RBAC) with clearly defined roles and permissions
13. Implement regular access reviews and automated deprovisioning procedures
14. Use strong authentication mechanisms including biometric and hardware tokens where appropriate
15. Implement privileged access management for administrative and sensitive operations
16. Design user provisioning and deprovisioning workflows that maintain security
17. Use identity federation for secure integration with external systems
18. Implement account lockout and anomaly detection for suspicious access patterns
19. Design password policies that balance security with usability requirements
20. Use just-in-time access provisioning for temporary elevated privileges

### üîê DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

#### **Comprehensive Data Security**

21. Classify all data based on sensitivity levels and implement appropriate protection measures
22. Use strong encryption algorithms (AES-256) for data at rest with proper key management
23. Implement TLS 1.3 or higher for all data in transit with proper certificate management
24. Design data loss prevention (DLP) systems to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration
25. Implement secure data backup and recovery procedures with encryption and access controls
26. Use data masking and anonymization techniques for non-production environments
27. Implement secure data deletion procedures that meet regulatory requirements
28. Design database security with proper access controls and query monitoring
29. Use tokenization for sensitive data like payment information and personal identifiers
30. Implement data integrity checks and validation to detect unauthorized modifications

#### **Privacy and Regulatory Compliance**

31. Implement GDPR compliance including data subject rights and consent management
32. Design CCPA compliance with proper data collection and sharing disclosures
33. Implement HIPAA compliance for healthcare data with proper safeguards and audit trails
34. Use SOC 2 Type II controls for service organization security and availability
35. Implement ISO 27001 information security management system requirements
36. Design privacy by design principles into all data collection and processing activities
37. Implement consent management systems that provide clear user control over data usage
38. Use privacy impact assessments for new features and data processing activities
39. Implement data retention policies that meet legal requirements and minimize data exposure
40. Design cross-border data transfer mechanisms that comply with international regulations
