# Clerk Authentication Setup Guide

## Fixing the "Invalid host" Error

If you're seeing the following error from Clerk:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Invalid host",
      "long_message": "We were unable to attribute this request to an instance running on Clerk. Make sure that your Clerk Publishable Key is correct.",
      "code": "host_invalid"
    }
  ]
}
```

Follow these steps to resolve it:

### 1. Register Local Development URLs in Clerk Dashboard

1. Log in to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/)
2. Select your application
3. Go to **Settings** > **Domains**
4. Add the following URLs to the allowed list:
   - `http://localhost:3000`
   - `https://localhost:3000`

### 2. Verify Your Clerk Publishable Key

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **API Keys**
2. Copy your **Publishable Key**
3. Open your `.env.local` file in the frontend directory
4. Ensure the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` value matches the key from the dashboard

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_key
```

### 3. Restart Your Development Server

After making these changes, restart your Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Error Handling Implementation

We've implemented proper error handling for Clerk authentication issues:

1. Added a `ClerkErrorBoundary` component that catches Clerk-specific errors
2. Created an `AuthError` component for displaying user-friendly error messages
3. Added a dedicated error page at `/auth/error.tsx`
4. Updated the `ClerkAuthProvider` to handle authentication errors gracefully

These changes ensure that users see helpful error messages instead of raw JSON errors when authentication issues occur.

## Additional Configuration

For production deployments, make sure to:

1. Add your production domain to the allowed list in Clerk Dashboard
2. Update your environment variables for production
3. Test the authentication flow thoroughly before deploying
