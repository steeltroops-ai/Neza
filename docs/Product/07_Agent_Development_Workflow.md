# ðŸš€ Neza Development Workflow - 30-Day Sprint Execution

## Strategic Purpose: Immediate Development Framework for MVP Delivery

**Target**: Ship production-ready MVP in 30 days with 100+ active bookings, 50+ verified providers, 4.5+ rating

---

## ðŸŽ¯ DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

### Foundation-First Architecture

- **No feature without prerequisites**: Authentication â†’ Provider Setup â†’ Customer Discovery â†’ Booking Flow
- **Shared component consistency**: Build once, use everywhere (buttons, forms, cards, modals)
- **Core flow prioritization**: Customer booking journey takes precedence over admin features

### Dependency-Driven Development

- **Week 1**: Foundation (layout, auth, landing) - enables all other development
- **Week 2**: Provider ecosystem (onboarding, listings, dashboard) - enables customer discovery
- **Week 3**: Customer journey (search, booking, payments) - enables transactions
- **Week 4**: Integration & launch (notifications, reviews, admin) - enables operations
