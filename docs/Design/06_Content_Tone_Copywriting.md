## üìù COPYWRITING PRINCIPLES

### Writing Rules
1. **Lead with Benefits**: Always start with what the user gains
2. **Use Active Voice**: "Book your service" not "Your service can be booked"
3. **Be Specific**: "Save 2+ hours" not "Save time"
4. **Build Trust First**: Address concerns before making claims
5. **Keep It Scannable**: Use bullet points, short paragraphs, clear headers

### Content Structure Formula
```
1. Hook (What's in it for them?)
2. Problem (What pain are we solving?)
3. Solution (How we solve it uniquely)
4. Proof (Why they should trust us)
5. Action (What to do next)
```

### Word Choice Guidelines
```
‚úÖ PREFERRED WORDS:
- Verified, Trusted, Secure, Instant, Professional
- Local, Community, Neighborhood, Nearby
- Guaranteed, Protected, Reliable, Quality
- Simple, Easy, Quick, Seamless, Effortless

‚ùå AVOID WORDS:
- Cheap, Discount, Deal, Bargain (implies low quality)
- Amazing, Incredible, Awesome (overused, not credible)

```
