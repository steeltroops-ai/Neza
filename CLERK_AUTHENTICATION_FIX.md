# Clerk Authentication Fix Guide

## Issue
The website was redirecting to Clerk's domain (`https://glad-collie-47.clerk.accounts.dev/...`) instead of showing the actual website.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_DEVELOPMENT_DOMAIN=localhost:3001` to `.env.local`
- Updated comment to register both `localhost:3000` AND `localhost:3001` in Clerk dashboard

### 2. Middleware Improvements
- Created custom middleware logic to detect and handle Clerk redirects
- Added `/clerk-error` to public routes
- Implemented a redirect handler for Clerk domain redirects

### 3. Custom Error Handling
- Created a `/clerk-error` page that provides a user-friendly error message
- Added helpful troubleshooting information

### 4. Configuration Updates
- Updated `next.config.js` to include Clerk domains in allowed patterns
- Added experimental configuration for Clerk components

### 5. Clerk Configuration
- Created a centralized `clerk-config.ts` file for better management
- Updated `Providers.tsx` to use the configuration

## How to Fix

1. **Register Your Development URLs in Clerk Dashboard**
   - Log in to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/)
   - Navigate to your application settings
   - Add both `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3001` to the allowed URLs
   - Also add `http://localhost:3002` if you're using that port

2. **Verify Your Clerk Keys**
   - Ensure your Clerk publishable key in `.env.local` is correct
   - The secret key should be properly set for backend operations

3. **Restart Your Development Server**
   - The server should now be running on port 3002
   - Visit http://localhost:3002 to see the website

## Testing the Fix

If you encounter any issues with Clerk authentication:

1. The middleware will now catch Clerk redirects and show a user-friendly error page
2. Check the browser console for any specific errors
3. Verify that your Clerk dashboard configuration matches your local environment
