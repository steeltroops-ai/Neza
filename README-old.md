Introduction
In a world where convenience, trust, and speed shape consumer decisions, local services remain fragmented, informal, and often inaccessible. Millions of individuals and small businesses provide critical services — from home repairs to tutoring, from wellness to event planning — yet lack the tools to connect with modern customers. Customers, in turn, struggle to find reliable providers quickly, transparently, and securely.

Velocity-first (recommended for immediate MVP): Next.js (TypeScript) + Supabase + Vercel + MeiliSearch + Stripe/Razorpay. Minimal ops, fastest dev loop, production-safe.

Production-first (if you want infra control from day one): Next.js (TypeScript) or Go backend (Gin/Fiber) + PostgreSQL (+PostGIS) on managed cloud (AWS/GCP) + Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) or Fly/Render for simpler ops. Use Redis, RabbitMQ/Kafka later, Elastic/Opensearch for search.

WHY these choices (short)
keep code in TypeScript for one language across frontend + backend — fastest iteration and fewer context switches. you already know JS/TS.

Next.js (app router): server components, API routes, SSR/SSG, image optimization, great on Vercel — ship UI + server functions fast.

Supabase (Velocity path) gives auth, Postgres, storage, realtime — minimal boilerplate, instant API.

Postgres + PostGIS for robust relational queries and geolocation (must for local matching).

MeiliSearch for instant, low-maintenance text+filter search (faster to integrate than Elasticsearch for MVP).

Stripe + Razorpay = global + indian payments; escrow logic lives server-side.

use Docker + GitHub Actions for reproducible builds & CI.

Velocity-first Stack (MVP, launch FAST)
Frontend

Next.js (TypeScript, app router)

React (function components + hooks)

Tailwind CSS (no heavy design libs)

Mapbox GL or Google Maps (Mapbox recommended for custom UI)

Backend / BaaS

Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime) — primary backend for MVP logic

Serverless functions (Vercel Serverless or Next.js API routes) for payment webhooks, escrow, heavy business logic

Database & Search

Supabase Postgres (with PostGIS extension via managed provider or switch to self-hosted Postgres when needed)

MeiliSearch (hosted or Docker) for fast service discovery and fuzzy search

Realtime / Notifications

Supabase Realtime (for booking status) + Vercel Edge Functions for push events

Twilio / Messagebird for SMS; Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push

Payments & Finances

Stripe (global) + Razorpay/Paytm/PhonePe for Indian UPI integration

Implement escrow: hold funds in Stripe Connect Transfer (or Razorpay Route) until completion

Media & Storage

Supabase Storage (or Cloudflare R2 / S3) for provider photos, invoices

DevOps / Hosting

Vercel for frontend + serverless functions

Supabase (hosted) as DB + auth

Host MeiliSearch on Render / Fly / small droplet

CI / CD / IaC

GitHub Actions

Terraform (only when moving off hosted services)

Monitoring / Error Tracking

Sentry for app errors

Logflare or Datadog (later)

Production-first Stack (if you want control from day one)
Frontend

Next.js (TypeScript) + Tailwind

API / Backend

Go (Gin / Fiber) or Node (NestJS, TypeScript) — choose Go if max perf/min CPU; choose NestJS if faster dev & full TS parity.

gRPC for internal microservices (later), REST for external APIs

Database

PostgreSQL (managed RDS/GCP SQL) + PostGIS for geolocation queries

Use Prisma (TS) or sqlc (Go) for type-safe DB access

Search

OpenSearch / Elasticsearch or Algolia (if budget) — OpenSearch for self-hosted cheaper ops

Realtime & Message Bus

Redis (pub/sub & caching) + BullMQ for jobs (or RabbitMQ/Kafka as load grows)

Payments

Stripe + Razorpay; integrate payouts with provider KYC and reconciliation via the backend.

Infra

Docker + Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) OR Fly.io for simpler scaling

Terraform for IaC

Auth

Keycloak or Auth0 or custom JWT with refresh tokens (use Supabase Auth for MVP then migrate)

Observability

Prometheus + Grafana + Loki for logs

Sentry for exceptions

ELK / OpenSearch for logs/search

CI/CD

GitHub Actions -> Docker images -> registry -> deployment

Essential Architecture (abstract)
Client (Web, PWA, Mobile) -> Next.js (React)

Edge / GraphQL REST -> Serverless functions or API Gateway

Core Services -> Booking service, Provider service, Payments service, Notification service

Data Layer -> Postgres (+PostGIS), MeiliSearch, Redis cache

Background Workers -> Job queue for payouts, reconciliation, matching, notifications

External Integrations -> Stripe/Razorpay, Mapbox, SMS/Email providers

MVP feature list (must-have)
User & provider auth (email / phone OTP)

Provider onboarding + profile (services, pricing, availability, verification upload)

Location-based search + filters (category, rating, price) — basic MeiliSearch / Postgres geo query

Instant booking flow with calendar availability check

Payment capture with escrow (stripe/razorpay) + payment webhooks

Booking status updates (accepted, en route, completed, cancelled) + realtime UI

Ratings & reviews

Provider dashboard: bookings, earnings (basic)

Admin dashboard: provider verification, disputes, payments reconciliation

Skip non-essential bells for MVP: loyalty programs, enterprise integrations, deep ML matching. Add later.

Developer ergonomics & repo layout
Monorepo (pnpm / turborepo) with apps/web, apps/api, packages/ui, packages/db

Types-first: shared types package used both frontend and backend

Use ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode, husky pre-commit hooks

Security & Compliance — non-negotiables
HTTPS everywhere, CSP, Rate limiting (api gateway)

KYC for providers before payouts (collect PAN / GST / ID depending on region)

PCI compliance via Stripe — do not touch card data on your servers

Data encryption at rest (managed DB), backups, and role-based access controls

Scaling plan — how to migrate without rewriting
Start with single Postgres DB, then shard read replicas and add a write master fallback.

Move MeiliSearch -> OpenSearch if search needs advanced ranking or huge dataset.

Replace Supabase with self-managed Postgres + Auth microservice when you need complex business logic.

Put heavy services (matching, payments reconciliation) into separate microservices with their own DBs later.

Introduce event sourcing or CQRS only when you hit complex concurrency or analytical needs.

Observability / Ops
log structure: JSON logs, correlation IDs per booking

distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) when microservices spin up

alerts on payment failures, queue backlog, high-latency DB queries

Costs & trade-offs (brief)
Velocity-first: low dev+ops cost, faster launch, vendor lock-in risk (Supabase/Vercel). Acceptable for MVP.

Production-first: higher initial cost and ops complexity, better long-term control and performance.

Minimal tech checklist to start coding today
repo: monorepo scaffold (turborepo + Next.js app)

connect Supabase project, enable auth + Postgres schema (providers, services, bookings)

integrate MeiliSearch instance (docker)

Stripe + Razorpay dev keys, implement webhook handler in Next.js API route

build provider onboarding + customer discovery pages, basic booking flow

deploy to Vercel, point DNS, enable Sentry

Final call — pragmatic pick
If you want to ship MVP this week or month: go Velocity-first. Next.js + Supabase + Vercel + MeiliSearch + Stripe/Razorpay. Minimal ops; you can demo real bookings and payments the fastest.

If you want control & resilience day one (and can handle ops/dev time): go Production-first with Go/NestJS + Managed Postgres + Kubernetes and full telemetry.
